    <h1><u>Harry Potter and the Cursed Child,</u></h1>
    <h2><u>About the Play</u></h2>
    <p><b>Harry Potter and the Cursed Child</b> is a play written by <b>Jack Thorne</b> from an original story by
        <b>Throne, J. K.Rowling and John Tiffany</b>. The plot occurs nineteen years after the events of Rowling's novel
        Harry
        Potter and the Deathly Hallows. It follows <i>Albus Severus Potter</i>, the son of Harry Potter, who is now Head
        of the
        Department of Magical Law Enforcement at the Ministry of Magic. When Albus arrives at Hogwarts, he gets sorted
        into
        Slytherin, and fails to live up to his father's legacy, making him resentful of his father. Rowling has
        referred
        to the play as "the eighth Harry Potter story".

    <h2><u>Plot</u></h2>
    <p><b>The play is divided in two parts, consisting of two acts each.</b></p>
    <h3><u><b>Act One</b></u></h3>
    <p>In the opening scene, set during the epilogue of Deathly Hallows in the year 2017, Harry and Ginny Potter send
        their younger son, Albus Severus Potter, on the Hogwarts Express to begin his first year at Hogwarts. Harry
        works as the Head of Magical Law Enforcement at the Ministry of Magic, while Ginny is the editor of the sports
        section of The Daily Prophet. Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger also send their daughter Rose on the train.
        Hermione is now the Minister for Magic, while Ron manages Weasley's Wizard Wheezes in Diagon Alley alongside his
        brother George. Aboard the Hogwarts Express, Albus befriends Scorpius Malfoy, the son of Harry's former foe
        Draco and his wife, Astoria. In a break with the tradition of Potters being sorted into Gryffindor, Albus is
        sorted into Slytherin alongside Scorpius.

        Both boys are bullied over the next years, with Albus perceived as failing to live up to his parents, and
        Scorpius being rumoured to be the son of Lord Voldemort. Astoria passes away due to a fatal disease. Albus and
        Harry drift apart, with Harry being uncertain about how to help Albus. The summer before his fourth year, Albus
        gets into a fight with Harry, after being given Harry's old baby blanket (which he had found sometime after his
        aunt Petunia had died (most likely from suicide due to her hatred of wizards and all the child abuse she got
        away with over the course of the franchise)) and a love potion from Ron. During the fight, Harry angrily says
        that he sometimes wishes Albus was not his son, and Albus spills the potion on the blanket.

        Harry obtains a prototype of a more powerful version of the Time-Turner, which allows one to travel into the
        past and change history. Simultaneously, Harry's scar starts hurting again, raising concerns that Voldemort may
        be returning. Amos Diggory, who is cared for by his niece Delphi, asks Harry to use the Time-Turner to prevent
        the death of his son, Cedric. After overhearing Harry refuse to help the Diggorys, Albus is inspired to do so
        and convinces Scorpius to help him. The two escape from the Hogwarts Express to visit Amos, and they team up
        with Delphi to steal the Time-Turner from Hermione's office, in the Ministry of Magic, while disguised with
        Polyjuice Potion</p>
    <h3><u><b>Act Two</b></u></h3>
    <p>As Cedric's death was the result of him winning the Triwizard Tournament[30] alongside Harry, the boys use the
        Time-Turner to travel back to the first tournament challenge. They disguise themselves as Durmstrang students to
        sabotage Cedric and prevent his victory. The plan fails, and the disguises cause Hermione to become suspicious
        of Viktor Krum, a Durmstrang student, and go to the Yule Ball with Ron instead. As a result, Ron never
        experiences the jealousy fundamental to his relationship with Hermione, and the two never marry. Ron instead
        falls in love with Padma Patil at the Ball, and Hermione becomes a frustrated professor at Hogwarts. Albus is
        now in Gryffindor.

        Meanwhile, Harry has nightmares about Voldemort. The centaur Bane tells Harry that a "dark cloud" is around
        Albus. Convinced that Scorpius is a threat to Albus, Harry tries to separate the boys at Hogwarts by attempting
        to force Headmistress Minerva McGonagall to keep tabs on Albus using the Marauder's Map.

        Albus and Scorpius' friendship is destroyed, but the two reconcile after Albus steals Harry's old Invisibility
        Cloak from Albus' older brother James. Harry relents after a conversation with Draco and Ginny. Meanwhile, Albus
        and Scorpius make another attempt to use the Time-Turner to save Cedric, this time by humiliating him during the
        Triwizard Tournament's second task. When Scorpius returns to the present day, Albus is not with him. Dolores
        Umbridge reveals that Harry is dead and Voldemort rules the wizarding world</p>
    <h3><u><b>Act Three</b></u></h3>
    <p>Scorpius discovers that his actions caused Cedric to join the Death Eaters and kill Neville Longbottom,
        preventing him from killing Nagini and thus allowing Voldemort to win the Battle of Hogwarts. With Harry now
        dead, Albus never existed, while Voldemort was able to consolidate power and transform the Ministry of Magic
        into a dictatorial regime. In the new timeline, Scorpius became a popular Head Boy and Quidditch star, helping
        the staff and students torment Muggle-borns. Umbridge became the new Headmistress of Hogwarts and patrols the
        school with Dementors and a revived Inquisitorial Squad, led by Scorpius.

        A dark figure called "The Augurey" leads the Ministry of Magic. With the help and sacrifice of alternate Ron,
        Hermione, and Severus Snape, Scorpius uses the Time-Turner to prevent his and Albus' past actions, and restore
        the original timeline. Scorpius reunites with Albus, and the two are found by their parents, as well as Ron and
        Hermione. Harry scolds Albus, but the two begin to reconcile.

        Realizing the danger the Time-Turner poses, Scorpius and Albus attempt to destroy it, when they are joined by
        Delphi. Scorpius notices Delphi's tattoo of an Augurey and realizes she was in charge of the Ministry of Magic
        in the alternate timeline. Delphi takes them captive, killing a fellow student in the process, and reveals her
        intention of restoring the alternate timeline.

        After Ron states he saw Albus and Scorpius with Delphi, Harry and Draco confront Amos, and discover Delphi had
        bewitched him into thinking she was his niece. Delphi takes the boys to the final challenge of the Triwizard
        Tournament, but Albus and Scorpius foil her plans, and Delphi uses the Time-Turner again to travel farther back
        in time. She inadvertently takes the boys with her, and destroys the Time-Turner to leave them stranded in time.

        Searching Delphi's room, Harry, Draco, Ginny, Hermione, and Ron discover hidden writing on the walls claiming
        Delphi is the daughter of Voldemort, and describing a prophecy that will allow Voldemort to return.</p>
    <h3><u><b>Act Four</b></u></h3>
    <p>Albus and Scorpius discover they have been taken back to the night before Harry's parents were killed. They write
        an invisible message on Harry's baby blanket, knowing in the present, the blanket would become stained with a
        love potion and expose the message. The message reads: "Dad.Help.Godric's Hollow.311081."

        Meanwhile, Draco reveals the Time-Turner was actually a prototype for a perfected model owned by him. After
        Harry receives the message from the boys, he and his allies use Draco's Time-Turner to travel back in time to
        save them and stop Delphi. They deduce she intends to convince Voldemort to abandon his attempt to kill Harry,
        ensuring his survival.

        Harry magically disguises himself as Voldemort to distract Delphi; after a struggle, the group subdues her.
        Rather than killing Delphi, they decide that she will be given a life sentence in Azkaban Prison. Voldemort
        appears, oblivious to Harry and the group, and they allow the murder of Harry's parents to play out, unwilling
        to risk altering the future again.

        After returning to the present, Delphi is sent to Azkaban. Albus and Scorpius decide to be more active at
        Hogwarts, with Scorpius expressing interest in trying out for the Slytherin Quidditch Team. He also asks Rose to
        be his girlfriend. She turns him down, but becomes more friendly towards Scorpius. Harry and Albus visit
        Cedric's grave, with Harry apologising for his role in Cedric's death. Albus and Harry grow closer. Harry and
        Draco overcome their old enmity, having been allied in foiling Delphi's plot</p>

    <h2><u>Characters</u></h2>
    <p>We know Harry, Ron and Hermione as well as we know our own friends. But Cursed Child also introduced us to a
        whole new generation of wizards and witches.</p>
    <h3><u>Albus Severus Potter</u></h3>
    <p>In Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows epilogue, we meet a young, nervous Albus Severus, so named after the two
        Hogwarts professors Harry was inspired by. Albus serves as our hero in Cursed Child, unwittingly following in
        the footsteps of his famous father.

        While Harry and Albus are seen not to get along in the play, Harry and his middle-son actually have a lot in
        common particularly that they are both reluctant heroes.

        Albus finds himself in Slytherin at Hogwarts the house he had worried about being chosen for. After this
        moment, his Hogwarts journey is marred by self-doubt, which affects his magical abilities.

        Albus has two other siblings: his older brother, the mischievous James Potter Jr. and his younger sister, Lily
        Potter Jr.who both get sorted into Gryffindor.</p>

        alt="Image of Albus Severus Potter" />
    <h3><u>Rose Granger-Weasley</u></h3>
    <p>Very much like her mother, Rose Granger-Weasley embodies all the same grace, wit and intelligence of Hermione.
        She also bears Ron’s cheekier side and glides into Hogwarts with immediate confidence.

        Sorted into Gryffindor, Rose seems to excel in everything, and unlike Hermione, even has a knack for Quidditch,
        being chosen for her house team as a Chaser.

        Despite a childhood friendship with Albus, and despite starting Hogwarts at the same time as each other, the
        pair start drifting apart in their earlier years at Hogwarts, with their separate Hogwarts houses not helping
        matters.</p>

        alt="Image of Rose Granger-Weasley" />
    <h3><u>Scorpius Malfoy</u></h3>
    <p>Scorpius is the only-child of Astoria Greengrass and Draco Malfoy, and unlike Draco Malfoy, Scorpius seems very
        different to his father. Despite sharing the same physical attributes, such as the blond hair, Scorpius
        immediately displays an empathy his father did not at his age. He joins Hogwarts at the same time as Albus
        Potter, forming an unlike friendship on the Hogwarts Express. This grows when the two of them are sorted into
        the same house, Slytherin.

        Unlike Draco, Scorpius focuses his Slytherin-like determination into his studies, being an avid reader. He’s
        also a self-confessed geek and adores sweets. Scorpius sadly loses his mother during the play and is shown
        lamenting her death with a heartrending speech.

        Although nervous and jumpy, like Albus, at the start of his Hogwarts journey, the young student becomes more
        self-assured as his adventures with Albus go on, despite having to contend with a rumour that he is Lord
        Voldemort’s son.</p>

        alt="Image of Scorpius Malfoy" width="350" height="400" />
    <h3><u>Delphi (Delphini) Diggory</u></h3>
    <p>At first, Delphi appears to be a plucky, colourful-haired helper working at St Oswald’s Home for Old Witches and
        Wizards, who focuses her efforts on her ‘Uncle’ the bereaved Amos Diggory, father of Cedric. But all is not as
        it seems.

        Despite not attending a wizarding school such as Hogwarts, Delphi is a smart and hugely talented witch with a
        penchant for Darker magic. She has a tattoo of an Augurey – a mournful, magical bird that symbolises death</p>
